# Overview
This project uses ROS noetic to demonstrate a simple line following Turtlebot in a simulated Gazebo environment . Line following is an easy to design application for a robot as all it requires is a robot with a camera and some tape. These robots can be made to follow these paths in periodic intervals autonomously and hence automate the function of the entire material handling system in a highly cost efficient way.
# Implementation
